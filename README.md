## FCC-Leaderboard

### Demo: https://sajibhaskaran.github.io/FCC-Leaderboard/

### Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that shows the Leaderboard of freecodecamp

#### User Story: I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

#### User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

#### User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
